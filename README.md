HokBot Book Of Shadows

You have no business here! This is coven business.

But if you insist then this is a CM bot.

_Objective_

Using technology to manifest intent 

Inspiration taken from a number of magical techniques:

* Austin Osman Spare’s approach to manifest of intent via reduction of a sentence to abstract letters and then to sigil design based on the assumption that images create a significant impact on the subconscious of the viewers and it is this that brings the manifestation to reality. His approach has had a significant impact on western magical practice for the past century.
* Chaos theory that a single action creates a series of cascaded events
* Egregores/thought forms created and modelled in each bot which grant their own unique approach. Made via programming the bots skill domain and individual personality tendencies. A software bot driven by artificial intelligence methods is an interesting and natural evolution of a long established concept.

_Input_

Each bot that forms the ‘coven’ or working group will each be programmed with specific domains of magical skill, knowledge and access to a particular tradition. They will also be assigned a role within that group. The egregore will further be enforced by naming and given some subtle variation in how they interact with each other and with the environment external to them.

The HP/HPS bot when instructed to enact a manifestation ritual will receive the request and arrange the construction of the result, which depending on the particular approach of the group, and the resultant charged/created sigil will then be disseminated via the group across the internet for manifestation.

_Output_

Each bot as part of its personality programming will be provided with a set of ‘interests’ which will form a number of features, one of which is how the group will cause the manifestation to occur and this is by interaction with the human group mind. ie social media

Injection of the resultant sigil into the public domain via subtle suggestion or direct imagery through the various social channels that each bot has interest in will allow for the the sigil to be activated knowingly or unknowingly when viewed in that channel. 

Although it is effectively a spam bot, it will be a subtle and directed one and it will fulfill the  approach of discordian chaos philosophy and therefore has value.

If the any of the bots has particular access to physical devices they will be used to further affect human reality.

Of course the bot is not 'magical' as such, we still require the innate ability of the human (sub)conciousness to act as interface to the universe (or multiverse) or event probablity.

_Randomness_

A source/seed of randomness as part of the input process is important and the bots will be well placed to source many forms, again, as part of their ‘interests’ for each bot.e.g:

They can sample the media streams they have access to:
* results of random interaction with people on these streams
* weather patterns
* traffic flow
* open data sources (census, etc)
* location information
* search engines (textural or image based)
* stock market data




_This Book Of Shadows_

This repo holds the C&C rituals for the bots to refer to, aids programming the bots for the chosen ritual, of course the bots can be programmed directly 
but here we like an ease of reuse feature. :-)

What this repo does not hold is the IRC bots or the backend code. That is somewhere else as the IRC server holds each bot private coven working group.
