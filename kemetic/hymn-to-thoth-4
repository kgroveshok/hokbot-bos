The ibis and the ink pot â€“ these are blessed.
For as the ibis pecks along the bank for a bit of food,
So the scribe searches among his thoughts for some truth to tell.
All the work is his to speak, its secrets writ down in his heart from the beginning of time,
The gods words rising upwards through his dark belly, seeking light at the edge of his throat.
In the beginning and at the end,
The book is opened and we see what in life we are asked to remember.
I ask of you _intent_
I complete this with your _sigil_
