hp: Mery baalat per nefer khat menat aru
This well of fire brings desires
The smoke will take our magic higher
Grant to us that which we seek
That will and wish at last shall meet
Willed with passion, wished with care
Send our spell now through the air    
Now we name the need so dire
Now we feed it to the fire
As we will it so mote it be!
