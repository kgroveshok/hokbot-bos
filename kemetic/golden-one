She is the Golden One,
The Mistress of the Goddesses,
She who comes in peace to her seat.
What a feast it is to behold her!
How sweet it is to look at her!
How happy is he who bows down before her because he loves her!
Gods and men acclaim her, goddesses and women play the sistrum for her.
She is the Mistress, the Lady of Inebriety,
She of the music, she of the dance.
