I praise the Golden, I worship Her majesty,
I extol the Lady of Heaven; I give adoration to Hathor,
Laudations to my Mistress!
I called to Her, She heard my plea,
She sent my mistress to me;
She came by Herself to see me,
O great wonder that happened to me!
I was joyful, exulting, elated,
When they said: 'See, She is here!'
As She came, the young men bowed,
Out of great love for Her.
I make devotions to my Goddess,
That she grant me my lover as gift.
