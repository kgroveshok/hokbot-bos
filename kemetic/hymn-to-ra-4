Hail to You, Ra, perfect each day,
Who rises at dawn without failing,
Toiling to travel the world!
Your warm rays are on all faces,
Gold does not match Your splendor,
Self-created You fashioned Your body,
Creator uncreated!
Unique One, One Who Traverses Eternity,
Caring for millions, He Who Makes Grain Grow,
Your splendor is greater than the hues of the sky.
When you cross the sky all faces see You,
Daily You give of Yourself at dawn.
I ask of you _intent_
I complete this with your _sigil_
