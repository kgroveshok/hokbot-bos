I am a great, yellow, stalking cat – Mesmerizer, Healer, Companion – tender and fierce, a beast of fur that blinks.
I know what I know in my body.
I hold the rat in my golden gaze.
I lick the dust from my kittens.
I am everywhere alert and at ease.
I wait in the moment, no longer flesh and fur, but the fact of a thing that waits, patient and anonymous as stone.
I am Cat: pounce, paws, and all.
I am Mau, what I call myself.
I am sun and dust, whiskers, milk and fur.
I ask of you _intent_
I complete this with your _sigil_
