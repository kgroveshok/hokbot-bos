Adoration to you, the Golden One,
The August and Powerful One in the Sanctuary-of-the-August-One,
The One Who Shines Like Gold in the Temple-of-the-Sistrum,
The Atenet in the Land of Atum!
I adore your majesty with your heart's desire.
I invoke your image with the sacred texts,
I exalt your ka (spirit) to the height of heaven,
I worship your image to the limits of the rays of the aten (sun).
Come in peace, progress in joy,
Your heart is sweetened by hearing prayers,
Hathor the Great, Mistress of Iunet,
The Eye of Ra, Mistress of Heaven,
Sovereign of All the Gods,
The Great Serpent, the Mistress of the Great Sanctuary,
Your beautiful face is satisfied with your beloved son,
The King of Upper and Lower Egypt,
Master of the Two Lands, eternally.
