The fire is laid, the fire shines
The incense is laid on the fire, the incense shines
Your perfume comes to me, o incense
May your perfune come to you, o incense
Your perfume comes to me, you gods
May my perfume come to you, you gods
May I be with you, you gods
May you be with me, you gods
May I live with you, you gods
May you live with me, you gods
I love you, you gods
May you love me, you gods
