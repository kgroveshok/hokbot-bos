Come to me, Thoth, O noble Ibis,
O letter-writer of the gods,
O great scribe!
Come to me and give me counsel,
Make me skillful in your calling!
Better is your calling than all callings,
It makes men great.
He who masters it is found fit to hold office.
I have seen many whom you have helped,
Grant me your wisdom, O Thoth!
I ask of you _intent_
I complete this with your _sigil_
