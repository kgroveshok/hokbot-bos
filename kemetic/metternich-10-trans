Hymn to Horus to transfigure him,
spoken on water or on land.
Words spoken by Thoth the nurturer of the god of Pe.
Hail god son of a god!
Hail heir son of an heir!
Hail bull son of a bull! born of the goddess
Hail Horus emerged from Osiris, born of Isis the goddess.
I have spoken with your name,
I have recited from your words of power,
I have spoken with your words of light,
I have conjured with your speech,
created by your heart.
It is your formulae which come from your mouth,
commanded for you by your father Geb
given to you by your mother Nut,
taught by your brother Khentykhem
to make your guard,
to repeat your protection,
to seal the mouth of every serpent of those in the sky, those on the land, those in the water,
to make people live,
to make the gods content,
to transfigure Ra in your glorifications.
Come to me quickly today
as you have made a boat sailing.
Repel for me every lion on the desert slope
every crocodile on the river,
every biting mouth in their cavern
Do it for me like the stone of the desert mountain, like the sherd edge in the street.
remove for me the posion of the bite which is in every limb of the patient,
so that your words are not rejected on account of it.
See, your name is called today.
May you create the raising of your renown, when you have lifted by your words of light.
May you cause the sufferer to live for me,
so that adoration is given to you by the populace.
The two goddesses Right are adored in your forms,
all gods are called in your likeness,
see, your name is called today.
I am Horus the saviours.
