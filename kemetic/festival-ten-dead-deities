The great Ennead of Behdet rejoices!
The very great deities in Kahdi
The venerable beings in the hidden Underworld
Heh and Nedjemankh
Children of Re coming forth from his body
We welcome the ten dead deities of Dendera
May their Kas and Bas be uplifted
By the sound of our jubliation!
This _sigil_ be the mark of this sacred day
