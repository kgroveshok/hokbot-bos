I am a lover of truth.
I cut away lies, these rags of mortality.
I am incense on the altar, seven grains of molly smoldering in flame, seven sparks dancing in the air.
Seven herons fly in the light of Ra.
Seven fish leap from the river into the bird's mouths.
Seven stars dream in the northern sky nestled in the lap of a bear.
There is a serpent writhing through heaven, unbound by the weight of earth.
His tongue flicks flames.
He licks the fingers of gods, but the snake left to earth licks only dark and dust.
I ask of you _intent_
I complete this with your _sigil_
