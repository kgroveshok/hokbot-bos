I praise the Golden, I worship Her Majesty,
I extol the Lady of Heaven; I give adoration to Het-Hert,
Laudations to my Mistress!
I called to Her, She heard my plea,
She sent my Mistress to me;
She came by Herself to see me,
O great wonder that happened to me!
I was joyful, exulting, elated,
When they said: "See, She is here!"
As She came, the young men bowed,
Out of great love for Her.
I make devotions to My Goddess,
That She grant me my sister as gift.
