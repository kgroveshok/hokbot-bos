it is not i who utters it
it is not i who repeats it
it is serqet who utters it
and it is she who repeats it
then, now and forever
come to me my goddess
si ki ri
si ki ri
si ki ri
i am a swallow
i am a swallow
i am the scorpion
the daughter of ra
oh hail ye gods whos scent is sweet
oh hail ye gods whos scent is sweet
oh hail the flame that cometh over the horizon
i stand before the double doors of double fire
open them
i am not afraid
for i have words to tell
welcome my goddess on this your festival
