The Mistress of Names in the Two Lands, the Unique One, 
Mistress of Terror among the Guardians of the Netjeru, the Uraeus on the horns of Atum
The Netjeru come to You prostrating, the Netjerut, bowing Their heads.
Your Father Ra adores You; His face rejoices in hearing Your Name.
Djehuty satisfies You with His glorifications and He raises His arms to You, carrying the sistrum. 
The Netjeru rejoice for You when You appear.
You illuminate the Two Lands with the rays of Your Eye.
The South, the North, the West, and the East pay You homage, and they make adoration.
Het-Hert, Mistress of Iunet, Your beautiful face is pleased by the King of Upper and Lower Egypt.
Welcome my goddess on this your _intent_
I complete this with your _sigil_
