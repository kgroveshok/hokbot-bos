Homage to You, Ra the Shining Sun.
Your beauties are in my eyes; glory comes into being over my skin.
The stars which never rest sing praises to You; the stars which never perish adore You.
You rise, You shine on the back of Your mother, crowned as Nesu Netcheru.
Your voice goes out to the earth, flooded in silence.
May you glorify my spirit; may you make Osiris, my soul, divine.
You are adored in peace, Lord of Gods; You are exalted by your wonders.
May You pour out radiance on my body.
I ask of you _intent_
I complete this with your _sigil_
