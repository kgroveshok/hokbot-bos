it is not i who repeats it
si ki re
hp: i enact my will as given in this image i create
hp: my will is _intent_ in this _sigil_ 
hps: i enact my will as given in this image i create
hps: my will is _intent_ in this _sigil_ 
our will is sent 
so mote it be in the name of our goddess serqet hetu het hor 
it is serqet who utters it 
and it is she who repeats it 
for i am but a mouth piece of the divine goddess 
serqet hetu het hor 
then now and forever 
come to me my goddess 
si ki re 
si ki re
