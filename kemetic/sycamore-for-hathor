I built a living house for the goddess made of the wood of a sycamore tree.
Under the leaves of the tree I eat bread in honor of her.
Each day I walk unceasingly on the banks of the river.
My soul reposes on the branches of the tree which I planted.
I refresh myself under the shadow of my sycamore.
Hathor, House of the Sun, live in my house forever.
