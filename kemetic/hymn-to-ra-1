Homage to thee, O RA, who risest as Tem-Heraakhuti.
Thou art adored. Thy beauties are before my eyes, and thy splendour falleth upon my body.
Thou goest to thy setting in the Seqtet Boat with fair winds, and thy heart is glad. The heart of the Matet Boat rejoices.
Thou stridest over the heavens in peace, all thy foes being cast down.
The stars which never rest hymn thee, and the stars which never vanish glorify thee as thou sinkest to rest in the horizon of Manu.
Thou art beautiful at morn and at eve, O thou Living Lord, the Unchanging One, my Lord.
Homage to thee who risest as Ra and settest as Tem in beauty.
Thou risest and shinest on the back of thy mother, O thou who art crowned king of the gods.
Nut pays homage to thee, and Maat embraces thee at morn and eve.
Joyfully thou stridest over the heavens and the Lake of Testes is content thereat. Thine enemy Sebau is cast down headlong, his arms and hands are cut off, and thy dagger has severed the joints of his backbone.
Ra has a fair wind, the Seqtet Boat advances and comes into port.
The gods of the South, the North, the West and the East praise thee, O thou divine substance, from whence all forms of life sprang.
Thou speakest--earth is flooded with silence, O thou ONLY ONE, who didst dwell in heaven before ever the earth and the mountain came into being.
O SHEPHERD, O LORD, O ONLY ONE, Creator of what is, thou didst make the tongue of the Nine Gods. Thou hast made all that sprang from the waters, and thou shootest up from them over the land of the pools of the Lake of Horus.
Let me breathe the air which comes from thy nostrils and the north wind which is from thy mother Nut. Glorify my spirit, O Osiris, make divine my soul.
O Lord of the gods, thou art worshipped at setting in peace, and art exalted because of all thy wondrous works,
Shine thou upon my body each day.
I ask of you _intent_
I complete this with your _sigil_
